			<h3>Clue #1</h3>
			<p>While we are accustomed to large lawns at golf courses or parks, in George Washington's time, grass was expensive to plant and maintain.  Guests were very impressed with this huge grassy area.

			<p>In George Washington's time, making cloth was a time-consuming job done completely by hand.  Sheep that supplied fleece to make wool were raised here at Mount Vernon.  Do you see the spinning wheel?  Skilled enslaved women, such as Alce (Alsee), turned a spinning wheel to twist the wool fiber into thread, which was woven into cloth on a </p>

			<p>Have you ever seen a porch as large as this one?  What do you think the Washingtons did here?  The Mansion was not air-conditioned, so on hot days or in the evening, family and guests gathered on the porch, ot piazza, to enjoy the breezes.  Besides having tea or other refreshments, the Washingtons could watch ships travel up and down the Potomac... </p>

			<p>Doing laundry in the Washington's time was hot and time-consuming work.  Enslaved laundresses, such as Dolsey and Vina, carried heavy buckets of water from the well to the wash house.

The walls have a top level that is even with the Mansion's lawn, and a ditch on the other pasture side.  Watch out!  If you don't see this wall, built into the hill, you might fall off and cause others to laugh.  Perhaps that is why it is called a...</p>
